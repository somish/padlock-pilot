Padlock is a platform for builders in residential construction to manage their entire operation - the contractors they hire, each task of the project, and soon payments / lending. It supports various activities, e.g. it escrows capital in a Gnosis multi-sig to prevent theft/missappropriated capital, automates payments upon multi-party verification of work being completed, is designed to support scaled operations (many projects, each with many tasks) etc.
